# Deep Gradient Compression: Reducing the communication bandwidth for distributed training ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01887))

## Introduction

* Gradient exchange is costly and dwarfs saving of computation time
* Network bandwidth becomes bottleneck for scaling up distributed training, even worse on mobiles (federated learning)
* Deep Gradient Compression (DGC) solves the communication bandwidth problem by compressing the gradients
